# radiation_impedance
A repository storing the code for the calculation of radiation impedance for rectangular clamped acoustic radiators. 
The provided code was developed as a part of a research paper titled "Radiation Impedance of Rectangular CMUTs".
This MATLAB script is capable of calculation based on both the 2D and 1D velocity profile approximations.
To use the script, please cite the original paper.
