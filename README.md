# radiation_impedance
A repository storing the code for the calculation of radiation impedance for rectangular flexural or piston-like acoustic radiators.
The same file is also published on Wolfram's cloud which can be accessed by (this link)[https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/khorassa/Published/Radiation_Impedance_of_Rectangular_CMUTs.nb]
